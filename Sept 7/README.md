The entire process of constructing a self-portrait through a programming language was compeletely unfamiliar to, which already made the assignment a challenge to begin with. 

The first struggle I had to do with my artistic approach to the self-portrait. I wanted to make something aesthetically pleasing, but since I am a beginner, I knew I wasn't yet equipped with the skills to make something perfect. However, in the end, I am proud of what I was able to achieve with the experience I have. I wanted to keep it simple, using this as a chance to get familiar with Processing; however, I still encountered numerous challenges (as follows):

# Proportions (Face)

I found it especially difficult trying to construct a face with shapes. My first attempts ended up looking extremely abstract. Making the features proportionate to each other took a lot of trial and error. Once I managed to get the main features of the face, I struggled with creating a mouth that was not just an arc. However, I still used the arc feature to create a mask. Ultimately, the mask covered the details of the face that I didn't know how to create.

# Background 

In addition to creating the portrait, I wanted to experiment with layering and using shapes and colors to create dimension. Although it wasn't an issue that interrupted my work, I found that layering was tedious and I was very inefficient. In the beginning, would type the individual code for each of the shapes in the layer. I then realized that it would go much faster if I just copy pasted the code of the previous shape and modified only the necessery elements (i.e. X,Y,Z).
