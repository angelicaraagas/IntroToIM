# Reflection

Creating this artwork was equally as challenging as the other assignments; however, I felt as though I was able to work more efficiently comapred to my other experiences. Through my growing confidence with Processing, I was able to build on the examples we went through in class to create an animated artwork using classes. Although I worked more efficiently, I still struggled with remembering which code produced certain results. To counter this, I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials, especially from *The Coding Train* and *John McCaffrey* 

Another issue I kept encountering was forgetting to put curly brackets in places that needed it and very simple spelling errors. Both of these issues were easily avoidable and were fixed by me rereading the code numerous times. I would get frustrated seeing error messages even though I knew nothing was conceptually wrong. For next time, I will be more attentive to spelling and other small details that can ultimately derail the entire project. 

Overall, I feel that I am slowly improving and gaining a lot more confidence with Processing after each project. I am able to build on the knowledge I gain after every class and create something new and interesting. Through my silly errors, I am now well aware of how I should approach code and am reminded of the attentiveness I need in order to work more efficiently and create better pieces.
