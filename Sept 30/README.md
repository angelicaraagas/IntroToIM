# Relfection 

This project was particulary hard for me. I wanted to display a randaom arrangement of the top 4000 most popular words in the english language; however, I kept on getting the error message **NullPointerException**

Even when I ran the program wihout the error, it would always crash. I am not sure why, but I am assuming it was an internal problem with my computer or the CSV file was too large for it to handle. 

Overall, I will continue to attempt more of these projects and perfect them. Even though I was not able to run this program successfully and consistanly, I will work on it again and create further improvements.
